# Topological-retina-simulator

This tool can populate a simplified mouse retina with rods, cones, retinal ganglion cells and horizontal cells in topologically "correct" manner. An alternating line pattern can be created and the difference in response to the standard and the inverse grid is simulated. This difference gives clue how well the line pattern is resolved. By changing parameters of network elements and their connection, one can obtain their influence on retinal resolution in qualitative manner.
